This is a description of how I moved forward with the exercise using brief notes and highlighting my learnings.

# Created a project folder for the bookserxercise backend

added standard config files,
installed mongoose
created book schema
created db using mongosh
created first example book using mongosh
checked if it's possible to find the example book in the db and print it to the console

# Adding CRUD methods via mongoose
The __v in MongoDB is only added when adding an element through mongoose but not for the element that was added via mongosh - why is this?
